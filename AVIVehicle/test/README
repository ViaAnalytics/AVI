Create and configure test Java project (not an Android Application Project)
	File -> New -> Java Project ...
	Project Name: AviVehicleTests
	Uncheck "Use default location" and choose the .../AviVehicle/test folder.

Add dependency on the Android project
	Select "Projects" tab at the top of the New Java Project dialog
	Click "Add ..."
	Check "AviVehicle"
	Click "OK"
	
Add required libraries
	Select "Libraries" tab at the top of the New Java Project dialog
	Robolectric jars
		Click "Add JARS"
		Select all jars from within AviVehicle/libs/test (including mockito), then click "OK"
	Android jars
		Click "Add External Jars"
		Navigate to your SDK install directory, then select "platforms/android-15/android.jar", choosing the API version to match the one you chose for Target when creating the Android project.
		Click "Open" to add android.jar
	JUnit
		Click "Add Library"
		Select JUnit, then click "Next"
		Change the JUnit version to 4 (Robolectric requires JUnit 4), then click "Finish"

Set classpath order
	Select "Order and Export" tab at the top of the New Java Project dialog
	Select android.jar, and move it down so that it appears below the robolectric jars
	Also move JUnit so that it is above android.jar
	Click "Finish", closing the new Java project dialog
	
Most of these settings can be changed later by right-clicking your test project, selecting "Build path" -> "Configure Build Path"

If the AviVehicle project is git tracked, and the new AviVehicleTests is not:
	Right click on AviVehicleTests
	Click Team -> Share Project ...
	Choose git
	See if the default checked "Use or create repository in parent folder of project" (which is what we typically do for our projects)
	Click "Finish"
